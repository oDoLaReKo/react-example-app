# TASK 1

This project contains the frontend app (written in the javascript and executed by the browser). The app is created with the React framework/library and typescript (stong-typed javascript). React dynamically embbeds HTML code on the website and handles the user interaction (e.g. clicks).

This project starts in the src/App.tsx file where we use SquareBox component. Component is a single code unit that contains:

- html code
- css code
- javascript code

and is responsible for a single element (Button, Square) or group of other components (SquareBox).

This application allows to add a green square and shows it on the screen on button's click. You can add as many squares as you want.

Read the \*.tsx code (don't focus right now on index.* files and react-app-env or reportWebVitals - you don't need it now) and try to understand it.

When you will be ready, then try to extend the code with following tasks:

## Task 1.1

Click on the "ADD SQUARE" button should add a square of random color from list available in `src/constants/colors.ts`

## Task 1.2

Add additional button "REMOVE SQUARE" that removes one of added squares.
