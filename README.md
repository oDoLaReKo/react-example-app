# React Example App ###

## Requirements

The app requires node.js v16.13.0 ([installator](https://nodejs.org/ko/blog/release/v16.13.0/)).

When installed, open the project folder in the Visual Studio Code, select Terminal > New Terminal (from the top navigation) and type in the opened terminal a following code:

```
npm i
```

This command installes the project dependencies.

## Run
